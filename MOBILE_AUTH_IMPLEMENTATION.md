## 🔑 Key Components

### AuthProvider (`src/components/AuthProvider.tsx`)
- Manages authentication state across the app
- Provides login, signup, logout, and profile management functions
- Handles session persistence and automatic profile fetching
- Includes proper error handling and loading states

### Supabase Client (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Configured with AsyncStorage for session persistence
- Uses project-specific URL and anon key
- Optimized for React Native environment

### Authentication Screens
- **Welcome**: Branded landing page with navigation to auth flows
- **Sign In**: Email/password login with "Remember me" functionality
- **Sign Up**: Registration with email confirmation
- **Forgot Password**: Email-based reset with success feedback
- **Onboarding**: Profile completion for new users

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Profiles Table
- Linked to `auth.users` via foreign key
- Stores user profile information (name, phone, location, etc.)
- Australian-specific fields (postal codes, states)
- Rating and verification system ready

### Security Policies
- Row Level Security enabled on profiles table
- Users can only access their own profile data
- Avatars bucket configured for profile pictures

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **New User Journey**:
   - Lands on Welcome screen
   - Signs up with email/password
   - Receives email verification
   - Completes profile in onboarding
   - Redirected to main app

2. **Returning User Journey**:
   - Automatic session detection
   - Direct redirect to main app if authenticated
   - Profile completion check for incomplete profiles

3. **Password Recovery**:
   - Enter email on forgot password screen
   - Receive reset instructions via email
   - Complete password reset via email link

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup
- Supabase project: `ulcrjgjbsromujglyxbu`
- Region: `ap-southeast-2` (Australia)
- Database includes full marketplace schema (listings, bookings, reviews, payments)

### Dependencies Added
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: Session persistence
- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Supabase client library

## 🚦 Routing Logic

The app uses a smart routing system:

1. **Index Screen** (`app/index.tsx`): Determines where to route users based on auth state
2. **Auth Guard**: Checks if user is authenticated
3. **Profile Completion Check**: Ensures profile has required fields
4. **Automatic Redirects**: Seamless navigation based on user state

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Loading States**: Spinners during async operations
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Form Validation**: Real-time input validation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Native Feel**: Uses React Native components for platform consistency

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Passwords must be at least 6 characters
- Email validation on both client and server
- Australian phone number validation
- Secure session storage
- Row Level Security on database
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## 🚀 Next Steps

The authentication system is complete and ready for production. Consider these enhancements:

1. **Avatar Upload**: Implement image picker for profile photos
2. **Biometric Auth**: Add fingerprint/face ID support
3. **Social Login**: Add Google/Apple sign-in
4. **Two-Factor Auth**: Enable MFA for enhanced security
5. **Profile Verification**: Add ID verification process

## 📝 Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the app: `npm start`
2. Test sign-up flow with a real email
3. Verify email confirmation works
4. Test sign-in with created account
5. Complete onboarding process
6. Test password reset functionality
7. Verify profile display and editing

The system is now ready for integration with the broader Rent It Forward marketplace features.
